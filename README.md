# WEB-SCRAPPING-USING
## Installation Steps

- **Step 1:** Choose the Website and Webpage URL
The first step is to select the website you want to scrape. For this particular tutorial, let’s scrape https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue 
- **Step 2:** Inspect the website
Now the next step is to understand the website structure. Understand what the attributes of the elements that are of your interest are. Right-click on the website to select “Inspect”. This will open the HTML code. Use the inspector tool to see the name of all the elements to use in the code.
- **Step 3:** Installing the important libraries. 
Python has several web scraping libraries. we will use the following libraries:
**requests** - for making HTTP requests to the website
**BeautifulSoup** - for parsing the HTML code
**pandas** - for storing the scraped data in a data frame
**time** - for adding a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the website with requests

- **Step 4:** Write the Python code
- **Step 5:** Exporting the extracted data
**Step 6:** Verify the extracted data
Open the CSV file to verify that the data has been successfully scraped and stored.
